How to Clear
============

## What is this?

This project contains a set of documents that teach you how to create
a Clear Linux OS derivative, which is, a Linux OS that uses most,
or all, of the Clear Linux OS content and organization, but differs
in some way.

This is useful for people who want to custom tailor the Clear Linux
OS for their personal or professional purposes, but remain to update
their content regularly with updates from [clearlinux.org].

The extent of the modifications that someone could make is not
limited. One could just change the organization and not the content,
or just remove content. Adding and modifying content and the kernel
is also covered.
